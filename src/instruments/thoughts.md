## Some thoughts about instruments

There should be a repository of instrument definitions. The data in it could be hardcoded or loaded from one or more files, probably both.

An instrument definition should help when creating staves. It should display warnings and errors when violating intrument rules.

An instrument definition contains

* ambitus
* valid clefs
* name
* rules for polyphony (violins can play up to 4 simultaneous notes; only two for lang time)
* special rules, like accept lyrics
