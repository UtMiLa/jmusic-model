# jmusic-model
A library intended to supply a model of a musical score and functions to manipulate it.

The model can be converted to a view model, which is a device-independent model of all music elements in the score.

The view model can be converted to a physical model with full instructions for how to draw the score, for example on a canvas or an svg.

This is under development. If you find it interesting and want to contribute, feel free to contact me or make a pull request.

The library is supposed to be lightweight, and I will not make complicated spacing algorithms to provide typesetting quality. There will be a function to export in Lilypond format for this purpose.
